# OpenTelemetry Minimal API Sample

To get started head over to [Honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io) and register for an account. You can also use the console exporter exclusively if you just want to see activity logged.

1. Update the configuration with your API Key
2. Run `dotnet ef database update`
3. Run the application to see telemetry captured from an incoming request, HttpClient calls, and database calls.

Have fun :)
